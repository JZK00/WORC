2.0.1 - Unreleased
------------------

Added
~~~~~~~
- Feature imputation settings in WORC config.
- PCA settings in WORC config.
- Dummy file, which can generally be accepted by WORC.
- Preprocessing is now a separate node before the calcfeatures node.
- Started working on a RTStructReader tool.


Changed
~~~~~~~
- Separate sinks for the output segmentations of the elastix and segmentix
  nodes.
- Switched from using PXCastConvert to WORCCastConvert, hence ITK is not
  anymore required as well as ITK tools.

Fixed
~~~~~
- Patientclass ID was used for both test and training. Now given separate names.
- When elastix is used but segmentix isn't, there was a bug.
- DataFile dataype is now a TypeGroup instead of an URLType.


2.0.0 - 2018-02-13
------------------

Added
~~~~~~~
- Elastix and transformix as separate workflow in the tools folder. Can be used
  through the WORC.Tools attribute.
- Example data for elastix and transformix tool.
- Workflow for separate training and testing set
- FASTR tool for applying ttest to all features. Works similar to the
  trainclassifier tool in terms of inputs and outputs.


Changed
~~~~~~~
- Option for multiple modalities. Supports infinitely many inputs per object.
- Moved many PREDICT parameters to the configuration file.
- When using a multimodal workflow with only a single segmentation,
  Elastix will automatically be used for registration. Note that you have to
  put the reference segmentation on the first modality!

Fixed
~~~~~
- Proper combining of features from multiple modalities to classify tool.
- Minor bugs in segmentix tool.
- For multiple modalities, add only optional sources like metadata when present.
